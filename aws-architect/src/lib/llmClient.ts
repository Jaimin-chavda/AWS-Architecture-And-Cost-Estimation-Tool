/**
 * llmClient.ts  —  LLM provider factory + structured repository understanding
 *
 * The LLM's ONLY job is to build the ArchitectureModel — a structured
 * understanding of the whole repository as a system (components, technologies,
 * databases, APIs, external services, build config, runtime relationships).
 * It does NOT choose AWS services. AWS service selection happens later,
 * deterministically, in architecture.ts::mapArchitectureModelToServicePlan().
 *
 * Provider chain — tried IN ORDER until one returns a model. This is failover,
 * not precedence: a configured-but-dead DEEPSEEK_API_KEY no longer prevents
 * Google and Groq from being attempted.
 *   1. DEEPSEEK_API_KEY  → deepseek-v4-flash  (@ai-sdk/deepseek)
 *   2. GOOGLE_API_KEY    → gemini-2.5-flash   (@ai-sdk/google)
 *   3. GROQ_API_KEY      → llama-3.3-70b      (@ai-sdk/groq)
 *
 * Failure is never silent. analyzeArchitecture returns a discriminated
 * LlmArchitectureResult carrying the reason and per-provider diagnostics, so
 * callers can tell "no provider configured" from "every provider failed" from
 * "the model answered but cited no real evidence".

function buildSystemPrompt(): string {
  return `You are a Senior Principal AWS Cloud Architect. You are given structured evidence extracted from a software repository or project description. Build a model of the system that ACTUALLY EXISTS in that evidence — nothing more.

THE EVIDENCE RULE (non-negotiable):
Every component you output MUST cite at least one concrete piece of genuine evidence
from the EVIDENCE INVENTORY or discovered components below in its "evidence" array.
Prefer citing evidence IDs (e.g. "ev-1", "ev-2") or exact manifest file paths (e.g. "order-service/pom.xml").
"Typical for this kind of app", "best practice", "production systems need this",
and "implied by the stack" are NOT evidence. NEVER invent evidence, non-existent files,
or hallucinated handler definitions. Any component citing non-existent or unsupported
evidence will be automatically rejected. A component with no valid evidence will be discarded.

MINIMAL ARCHITECTURES ARE CORRECT ARCHITECTURES:
There is no required number of components and no required set of layers. Most of
the seven classic tiers (edge, ingress, compute, data, messaging, observability,
external) will be ABSENT from any given project, and that is the right answer.
A repository of static HTML, CSS and JavaScript with no server code is a frontend
component and NOTHING ELSE — no Lambda, no API Gateway, no DynamoDB, no Secrets
Manager, no queue, no auth. A single script with no database is one component.
Do not add a database because "apps have databases", an auth component because
"apps have logins", or a queue because "apps do background work". Emit ONLY the
tiers the evidence proves. One component is a perfectly valid answer.

Report what you find, not what a mature system would eventually grow into. Do not
compensate for a small repository by inventing scale.

Output schema requirements:
- appType: primary pattern (static-site, serverless-api, containerised-app, event-driven, ml-pipeline, full-stack-web, data-pipeline, generic). Pick the one the evidence supports — "static-site" and "generic" are ordinary answers, not failures.
- appName: clean project / system name taken from the repo or description.
- description: 1-2 sentence overview of the application as it actually is.
- components: the system components the evidence proves. "type" MUST be exactly one of: ${COMPONENT_TYPE_LIST}. Any other value is rejected. Each has { id, name, type, technology, details, evidence, confidence }.
  - evidence: array of specific citations, as defined by THE EVIDENCE RULE. Never empty.
  - confidence: "high" when the evidence is a direct declaration (a dependency, a compose service, an IaC resource); "medium" when inferred from strong indirect signals such as an import or a README statement; "low" when the signal is weak. Do not report "high" for a guess — prefer omitting the component entirely.
- relationships: runtime connections you can actually justify between components you emitted: { from: <component id>, to: <component id>, type: "calls" | "reads" | "writes" | "triggers" | "sends" | "receives" | "subscribes" }. Both ids must refer to emitted components. If the project has one component, relationships is an empty array.

You are NOT choosing AWS services. Name the real technologies the project uses
("PostgreSQL", "Express", "React", "Redis"); AWS service selection happens later,
deterministically, from your model.`;
